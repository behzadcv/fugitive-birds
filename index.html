        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        Firstly thank you very much for being here and I am so grateful for considering my application.
        This page and this little game have been prepared for my application for Roivio company.<br/><br/>
        Please consider that I have implemented this game from scratch in less than a week, and it is developed by using pure Javascript and HTML5 and I did not used any other library or framework except jQuery; moreover, its graphics and illustrations which are inspired by Angry Birds game are designed by me from scratch during those days. Although I know that it is not a perfect game I hope that it can show my motivation and skills for this position.<br/><br/>

          </div>
        In addition to my programming skills, I have more than 10 years experience in graphic design and I am very handy with designing software such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Corel Draw and Freehand; and also I am familiar with 3D Studio max and Vray as well. As a master student in Networking technology my studies are related to IT field, and besides programming courses that I have passed during my studies I have lots programming experience in C, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python. (You can find the complete list of my programming skills in my <a href="http://www.behzadcv.com/images/CVgraphic.pdf">resume</a> file). Therefore, I believe that the combination of these skills make me able to combine design and coding to create a fancy games or application.<br/> <br/>

        <h2><b>Seasons Photo Album</b> - Django, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Ajax - University Assignment</h2>
        This project is not completed and not deployed on a public server yet, but the main part including creating and modifying photo albums are finished at the moment. The key point that makes my project distinctive in compared to other ones is that the creating and modifying albums processes are implemented by using jQuery and Javascript, so every element is generated on the fly and this approach enables end user to see the final result during creating and modifying albums. Moreover, I have used Ajax for sending requests to the server, it helps end user to have a better experience while using this web application.

            The purpose of this project was implementing an HTTP/DNS proxy that can response to GET, PUT and POST requests. The server can be run as a daemon process and also it is possible to execute it in a debug mode, which runs in foreground and print some messages during its operation to the standard output. TCP and UDP connection, generating IPv6 and IPv4 DNS query and response and HTTP requests and file transfer are implemented in this project. This project has been implemented in solo.
